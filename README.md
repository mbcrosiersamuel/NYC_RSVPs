Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is a small, single page website to aggregate when 
reservations open at popular New York City restaurants. In 
addition to the searchable/sortable raw data by restaurant, 
there's a calculator that lets you pick a restaurant and desired 
reservation date, then calculate when reservations open.

## Features

- **Restaurant Database**: Searchable and sortable data for popular NYC restaurants
- **Reservation Calculator**: Calculate when reservations open for your desired restaurant and date
- **Timing Analysis**: Detailed explanation of why reservation timing is so complex

The restaurant data is not actually a database, but is stored in the script.js file.
